# Personal Coaching Service Website - UX Design

## Project Description
This project is designed for a coaching professional who wants to promote their services online. The UX goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that clearly conveys the coach’s expertise, builds trust, and provides easy pathways for potential clients to learn more, book services, and get in touch. This project includes a full user flow from the landing page to booking, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

## Tools & Technologies

- **README.md**: Documentation for project overview, UX design process, and implementation details.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end development (if needed).
- **Optional - Webflow or WordPress**: For faster prototyping and deployment of the design.

3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**:
   - Develop detailed page designs, using color schemes, fonts, and imagery that reflect the coach’s personal brand.

4. **Prototyping**:
   - Link pages and interactions in Figma to simulate the user flow.
   
5. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing to gather feedback on navigation and ease of use.
   
6. **Refinement**:
   - Use insights from testing to iterate on the design, focusing on simplifying the user journey.
